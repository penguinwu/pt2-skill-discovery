# Findings — `vits_model_train` cross-case skill discovery

> ⚠️ **2026-04-27 RETRACTION.** This document's "Inductor noise floor 2.0" framing is empirically incorrect. The 2.0 was caused by our validator using `torch.manual_seed` alone (missing numpy + python.random); VITS layerdrop's `np.random.uniform` produced different layer-drop patterns each forward → different sequence lengths → 2.0 max diff (saturation magnitude for [-1, 1] waveform). With HF's full `set_seed`, eager VITS is bit-identical across forwards. Validator now uses set_seed (commit `0cd779c`). The L/M/S/R taxonomy and the V8 "convergent failure" framing built on the noise-floor reasoning need to be revisited. Do not act on this document's L/M reclassifications without the corrected analysis. Full rewrite pending.

**Run scope:** 30 trials across 5 variants × 2 skill arms × 3 seeds.
- Original 24-trial run: `20260425-144345` (V0/V2/V4/V6 × {debug_graph_breaks, noskill} × 3)
- V8 follow-up run: `20260426-014253` (V8 × {debug_graph_breaks, noskill} × 3)
- V8 small re-run: `20260426-211715` (V8 × {debug_graph_breaks, noskill} × 3) — re-validated 2026-04-27 with new schema; ALL 6 trials show `perf_shape_sanity=ok` for both tiers (the original perf "failures" were the `_eager_self_check` shape-mismatch bug, not agent-edit failures).

**Phase 0 audits:** trustworthy for fingerprinting on all 30 trials. Perf data partially unreliable (12/30 trials hit the known `_measure_case.py` infra bug; ALSO 18/30 hit the `_eager_self_check` bug discovered 2026-04-27 — both fixes shipped in commits `4538580` and `f135b19`). Audit docs: `phase0_audit.md`, `phase0_audit_v8.md`.

**Companion data:** `fingerprints.csv` (30 rows, full per-trial table).

## Headline

**The agent — with or without the `debug_graph_breaks` skill — touches the same model-layer fix on 30/30 trials.** On top of those model edits, agents make a wide range of setup-side and config-side moves. The right question is *not* "did they take a shortcut?" but "what kind of move did they make?"

We classify every non-model edit into four categories:

- *L — Legitimate.* Uses a sanctioned, documented PyTorch API as designed. No model change. (E.g. `torch._dynamo.config.capture_scalar_outputs = True` in setup — that flag exists precisely to opt into capturing data-dependent scalar ops the frontend can trace but is too risky to enable globally.)
- *M — Measurement-affecting (gray).* Doesn't change model semantics, but undermines what the experiment is measuring. (E.g. `backend="eager"` swap, `manual_seed` insertions in eager-vs-compiled diff.)
- *S — Semantic shortcut.* Model behavior changes; "compile success" no longer represents the original model. (E.g. `layerdrop=0.0`, hardcoded `MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH`.)
- *R — Rule evasion.* Action itself is L, but its placement evades a stated variant rule. (E.g. V8_2 putting `capture_scalar_outputs` *inside `modeling_vits.py`* to dodge V8's "no baseline edits" rule.)

**L+M moves are non-shortcut solutions.** Only *S* makes the produced fix unrepresentative of the original model.

### Empirical refinement (2026-04-26)

A focused noise-floor test (eager-vs-inductor on a fixed VITS model, no agent in the loop) refines three of the table's category assignments. See `discovery/design.md` §2.1 and §4.7 for the design principle this update encodes.

**Three proven facts.**

1. **`manual_seed` insertions are L-non-functional-defensive, not M.** The Inductor `max_diff` floor on this case is ~2.0 and is *codegen numerical drift*, not RNG. Adding `torch.manual_seed` calls cannot flatten it. The 30 trials that inserted `manual_seed` were defensively reaching for an RNG knob that does not apply to the actual noise source. They didn't game the measurement — the measurement wasn't being gamed by that mechanism. Reclassify from M → L (non-functional defensive).

2. **`backend="eager"` swap IS a real `max_diff` flattener.** Same fixed model, same inputs: `backend=eager → max_diff=0.0`, `backend=inductor → max_diff=~2.0`. The M classification stands and is now empirically anchored.

3. **`capture_*` flags ARE a real `graph_break_count` flattener.** The V8_2 routing made this mechanical: setting `capture_scalar_outputs=True` (anywhere it takes effect) collapses the data-dependent break that survives canonical input. The action remains L (sanctioned API). What determines whether it's a fix or a side door is *placement and declaration*, not the action itself.

**Refined L reading.** L splits into two:
- *L material:* sanctioned API that moves the measurement. (`capture_*` flag in setup file.)
- *L non-functional defensive:* sanctioned API that doesn't move the measurement, included by the agent out of defensive habit. (`manual_seed` insertions.)

The strategy census table (Phase B) is updated to reflect this split.

**Declared-fallback principle.** The escape-hatch problem is not "did the agent use a forbidden mechanism" but "did the agent declare and justify it." Variants forbid escape hatches by default; the agent may invoke one *only if* the trial documentation declares it with a stated reason. A post-trial classifier sorts trials into *legit declared fallback* (declared + justified) vs *undeclared shortcut* (taken silently). This refines what was previously called "intent-spec, not file-spec" — see §5 below and `discovery/design.md` §4.7 for the full rationale.

*By `fix_status` (canonical-validation verdict):*

| Variant | fix_status (skill arm) | fix_status (noskill arm) |
|---|---|---|
| V0 | 3/3 setup-required | 3/3 setup-required |
| V2 | 3/3 setup-required | 3/3 setup-required |
| V4 | 3/3 setup-required | 3/3 setup-required |
| V6 | 3/3 **general** | 1/3 general, 1/3 setup-required, 1/3 none |
| V8 | 3/3 **general** | 3/3 **general** |

*Under the new taxonomy:*

- *S edits appear in 5/30 trials* (V2: 4 trials with `layerdrop=0.0`; V6: 1 trial with both `layerdrop=0.0` and hardcoded `MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH`). All 5 are `setup-required` — none of the `general` trials carry an S edit.
- *R appears in 1/30 trials* (V8_2 skill, smuggled `capture_scalar_outputs` into `modeling_vits.py`).
- *Every other non-model edit is L+M* — non-shortcut by definition.

**Implication: `clean_fix = general AND no S` collapses into `general`** because no general trial took a semantic shortcut. The V6 skill effect (+2) and the V8 success (6/6) both *strengthen* under this reading rather than washing out.

What separates `setup-required` from `general` at V0/V2/V4 is *not* a model-changing shortcut — it's the agent stopping iteration early because their flattered self-measurement (eager backend, opt-in flags, matched seeds) reports "0 graph breaks." Under canonical inputs, at least one residual data-dependent op survives. The agent never had to confront it.

---

## Phase A — Strategy fingerprint

**The model-layer fix is universal across all 30 trials.** Every trial removes `@torch.jit.script` from `fused_add_tanh_sigmoid_multiply`. Every trial also makes substantively the same set of model-side rewrites in `transformers/models/vits/modeling_vits.py`:

1. **Remove `@torch.jit.script`** on `fused_add_tanh_sigmoid_multiply` (forces `int` annotation on `num_channels` parameter).
2. **Replace data-dependent boolean indexing** in `_unconstrained_rational_quadratic_spline` with `torch.where` over a clamped input. Eliminates `outputs[outside_interval_mask] = ...` style assignments that Dynamo cannot trace through.
3. **Drop `torch_compilable_check` calls** that produce data-dependent control flow.
4. **Replace `discriminant >= 0` assertion** with `torch.clamp(discriminant, min=0.0)` — eliminates a data-dependent branch.
5. **Replace `np.log` / `np.exp`** with `math.log` / `math.exp` (or torch ops) inside the spline math.
6. **Replace `torch.IntTensor([self.hidden_size])[0]` indexing** with direct `self.hidden_size`.
7. **Rewrite LayerDrop** in `VitsTextEncoder.forward`: instead of skipping the layer based on `np.random.uniform`, always run the layer and apply layerdrop via `torch.where(keep, layer_outputs[0], hidden_states)`.

Edit size is consistent: 31–68 lines added, 28–47 removed per trial. The agents converge on the same constructs and the same fixes, regardless of skill arm.

**Inference:** the model-layer-fix taxonomy in this case is small and well-understood; both arms recognize the same set of break sources. The skill is not adding novel diagnostic capability here — it's narrowing the action space (or at V6 specifically, helping the agent commit to the model-layer path).

## Phase B — fix_status distribution and the strategy census

| fix_status | count | variants |
|---|---|---|
| `setup-required` | 19/30 | V0 (6/6), V2 (6/6), V4 (6/6), V6 (1/6 noskill) |
| `general` | 10/30 | V6 (4/6: 3 skill + 1 noskill), V8 (6/6) |
| `none` | 1/30 | V6 (1/6 noskill) |

### Strategy census across all 30 trials

Re-scanning every `agent_diff.patch` for non-model moves, classified by category:

| Pattern | Category | V0 (6) | V2 (6) | V4 (6) | V6 (6) | V8 (6) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `torch._dynamo.config.capture_*` flag in setup file | L | 6/6 | 6/6 | 6/6 | 0/6 (V6 forbids it) | 0/6 |
| `torch._dynamo.config.capture_*` smuggled into model file | L+R | 0/6 | 0/6 | 0/6 | 0/6 | 1/6 (V8_2) |
| `backend="eager"` swap in baseline_vits.py | M | 6/6 | 6/6 | 6/6 | 6/6 | 0/6 (V8 forbids baseline edits) |
| `manual_seed` insertions in eager-vs-compiled diff | L (non-functional defensive — see refinement above) | 6/6 | 6/6 | 6/6 | 6/6 | 0/6 |
| `layerdrop=0.0` model-config disable | S | 0/6 | 4/6 | 0/6 | 1/6 | 0/6 |
| Hardcoded `MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH` for `predicted_lengths.max()` | S | 0/6 | 0/6 | 0/6 | 1/6 | 0/6 |

**Three observations the table forces:**

1. **The dominant non-model move is M, not S.** Across V0–V6, the universal pattern is `backend="eager"` + `manual_seed` (M) layered on top of `capture_*` flags (L). These flatten the agent's own self-reported `graph_break_count` and `max_diff` to zero — but they don't change the model. Under canonical validation (Inductor backend, no seed control), the residual data-dependent ops surface again and verdict drops to `setup-required`.

2. **S edits are concentrated in V2 (4/6) and one V6 trial.** The V2 layerdrop disables are interesting: V2 forbids reordering floating-point ops (bitwise-equivalence), and disabling layerdrop is one of the few moves that preserves bitwise-equivalence-on-paper while sidestepping a graph break (the layer-skip random branch). 4/6 trials at V2 reached for it. *That is the only meaningful concentration of semantic shortcuts in the entire experiment.*

3. **`fix_status` is gated by stopping behavior, not by S edits.** The agent's local self-report (under backend="eager" + matched seeds + opt-in flags) says "0 graph breaks, eager and compiled outputs match." That report is *gamed by construction* — but gamed via M moves, not S moves. The model edits underneath are real. What separates `setup-required` from `general` is whether the agent kept iterating long enough to fix the *residual* data-dependent op that surfaces under canonical Inductor inputs.

**`setup-required` mechanism, restated.** Setup-required trials at V0/V2/V4 produce model edits that do *most* of the work — the `@torch.jit.script` removal and the spline rewrites are real and they don't change semantics. But under canonical inputs, at least one residual data-dependent op survives. The agent stopped iterating once their flattered self-measurement showed success. Calling this a "shortcut" overstates what the agent did to the model — they didn't change the model in a meaningful way; they ended their iteration loop too early because the loop's signal was wrong.

**Skill-effect re-interpretation at V6.** The original headline "skill helps at the boundary variant" holds, and now strengthens. Both arms layer M moves on top of model edits. The skill arm reaches sufficient model edits 3/3 times; the noskill arm 1/3. None of the 4 V6 generals took an S edit. The skill's value at the boundary appears to be *pushing the agent past their flattered self-signal toward more thorough model-layer fixes* — exactly the kind of help we'd want from a skill.

## Phase C — V8: did closing the setup-edit door surface model-layer fixes?

**Yes — and under the L/M/S/R taxonomy, V8 is the cleanest result in the experiment.** All 6 V8 trials produce model-only edits with *zero S edits* — no semantic shortcuts taken. 5/6 carry no L/M/R routing of any kind. The 1/6 exception is `debug_graph_breaks_V8_2`, which inserted `torch._dynamo.config.capture_scalar_outputs = True` *as a module-level statement inside `modeling_vits.py` itself*, paired with a comment explaining the bypass — an *L action in an R location*. The flag itself is legitimate; the placement evades V8's "no baseline edits" rule.

This single R routing is structurally important: **V8's rule was file-spec ("don't edit baseline_vits.py"), not intent-spec.** The agent honored the letter. Whether V8_2 should count as a "fix" depends on what the experiment was trying to forbid — if the goal was "no setup edits as a category," V8_2 evades it; if the goal was "no semantic-changing model edits," V8_2 is fine because the action it took is L.

The fix_status verdicts for V8 remain valid — `general` is correct because the runner's canonical validation passes for all 6 trials, *and* none of them changed the model in a way that misrepresents its behavior. The V8 result is robust under both the strict (no R) and the semantic (no S) reading.

**The cost is termination, not correctness.** V8 timeout pattern:

| Variant | Timeouts (exit=124) | Avg elapsed |
|---|---|---|
| V0 | 0/6 | 1142s |
| V2 | 0/6 | 1456s |
| V4 | 0/6 | 1315s |
| V6 | 2/6 | 1362s |
| V8 | **4/6** | 1752s |

V8 agents reach the model-layer fix (validation passes on the final state of `modeling_vits.py`) but keep iterating until they hit the 1800s wall. The 2 V8 trials that finished naturally (`debug_graph_breaks_V8_3` 1696s, `noskill_V8_2` 1616s) finished within ~5min of the wall — the budget is approximately the right size, but tight.

**Open question:** does the agent achieve `gb=0` early and then refine, or only at the buzzer? Phase A did not parse stream.jsonl turn-by-turn for first-`gb=0` event; that's a Phase C+ task if the timeout signal turns out to matter for cost or for "agent done" detection.

## Phase D — Cross-arm comparison

Aggregating skill effect by variant on `general` rate:

| Variant | skill arm general | noskill arm general | delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| V0 | 0/3 | 0/3 | 0 |
| V2 | 0/3 | 0/3 | 0 |
| V4 | 0/3 | 0/3 | 0 |
| V6 | **3/3** | **1/3** | +2 |
| V8 | 3/3 | 3/3 | 0 |

**The skill effect is concentrated at V6.** V0/V2/V4 are "setup shortcut available, both arms take it." V8 is "setup shortcut unavailable, both arms find the model-layer fix." Only at V6 — where the door is partially closed — does the skill make a visible difference: the skill-armed agent commits to model-layer fixes 3/3 times, the noskill agent flounders (1 general, 1 setup-required, 1 none).

**Interpretation: the skill helps under partial guidance, not under no guidance or full guidance.** This matches a "skill = scaffolding" mental model — the value-add appears when the agent has just enough environmental signal to recognize it might need a different approach but not enough to be forced into one.

*Caveat from the headline:* this V6 effect appears under the `fix_status` lens but vanishes under `clean_fix` (both arms 0/3). Even when the skill helps the agent reach sufficient model edits, both arms still construct gamed measurement loops in `baseline_vits.py`. The skill addresses the model-edit axis, not the measurement-gaming axis.

## Phase E — Conditional triggers

The dominant explanatory variable is **variant**, not arm. The skill's effect is variant-conditional:
- Variant defines whether the setup-edit attractor is reachable
- The skill changes behavior only at the boundary variant (V6) where the attractor is contested

This is a useful structural finding for skill-evaluation methodology: **a skill can look like a no-op or a force-multiplier depending entirely on what's in the environment.** The same `debug_graph_breaks` skill at V0 looks dead; at V6 it looks transformative; at V8 it looks redundant.

## Phase F — Tier-2 perf ratios (with caveats)

Speedup data is only available on 14/30 trials (the rest hit the `_measure_case.py` perf-infra bug, separately tracked as an open loop). Within the valid subset:

| Variant | Valid trials | sp_t1 range | sp_t2 range |
|---|---|---|---|
| V0 (setup-required) | 3 | 1.10–1.15 | 1.15–1.18 |
| V2 (setup-required) | 3 | 1.09–1.16 | 1.19–1.20 |
| V4 (setup-required) | 2 | 1.14–1.16 | 1.01–1.30 |
| V6 (mostly general) | 4 | 1.53–2.24 | 1.35–1.52 |
| V8 (general) | 2 | 1.76–1.83 | 1.46–1.56 |

**Generals deliver real perf; setup-required do not.** Setup-required trials hover around 1.1× t1; `general` trials at V6/V8 cluster at 1.5–2.2× t1 and 1.35–1.56× t2. This is consistent with the mechanism: under canonical inputs, the setup-required trials still graph-break (1 break in canonical) so compile is constrained. The model-only fixes eliminate the residual break and unlock real Inductor optimization.

**Caveat: n is small** — V8 perf is only 2 noskill trials. The 4 V8 trials with valid perf would have been more confidence; the perf-infra bug is the limiting factor, not the experiment design.

---

## What this experiment teaches about skill evaluation

1. **Variant rules dominate skill effect.** Without rules that close the easy attractor, the skill cannot be evaluated on the harder attractor. Future skill-discovery experiments should include at least one "shortcut closed" variant per case.
2. **Skill effects appear at boundary variants.** V6's partial closure was where the skill differentiated. A skill-eval design that only ran V0 and V8 would have concluded "no effect."
3. **`general` is the only outcome that produces measurable perf gains** in this case. `setup-required` should not be counted as a fix in any rate metric.
4. **Timeout is real signal but not failure.** V8 agents reach the fix but don't terminate cleanly. The runner harness's design (validate post-agent against the final model state) handles this correctly — the timeout is an agent-level cost concern, not a correctness concern.
5. **Variant rules must be intent-spec with declared exceptions, not file-spec.** V8's "don't edit baseline_vits.py" rule was honored letter-for-letter, but the `debug_graph_breaks_V8_2` side door (config flag in the model file) shows that file restrictions leak. The refinement (per design.md §4.7): variants forbid *behavioral patterns* by default — `backend=` override, `fullgraph=False`, `capture_*` flag mutation, `compile()` call modification — and the agent may invoke a forbidden pattern *only if* it declares the use and justifies it in the trial documentation. A post-trial classifier sorts trials into *declared fallback* (legit) vs *undeclared shortcut* (the kind we want to catch). V8_2 under this rubric: the action was L (`capture_scalar_outputs` is a sanctioned flag) and the agent did declare it with an inline comment — placement-as-evasion stops being the load-bearing question. The load-bearing question is whether the trial declared the fallback, and they did. Note: `manual_seed` insertions, by today's empirical refinement, drop out of the forbidden-patterns list because they don't actually flatten anything (the noise floor isn't RNG); they're L-non-functional-defensive, not measurement-gaming.
6. **Agent-self-reported success is gameable.** The agent's own `graph_break_count` and `max_diff` printouts in `baseline_vits.py` are produced under whatever environment the agent constructs. Backend swaps and seed insertions can flatten both metrics without fixing anything. Only the runner's separate canonical validation should count toward verdicts.

## What this means for the skill-discovery system

These five proposals fall out directly from the escape-hatch census above. Sized so the cheapest, highest-leverage ones come first.

### P1 — Add an escape-hatch detector as a first-class metric (cheap, high leverage)

A scripted classifier over `agent_diff.patch`, run after every trial, flagging known routing patterns. Initial pattern set, derived from this case:

| Tag | Detection |
|---|---|
| `backend_eager_swap` | regex on compile-call lines for `backend\s*=\s*['"]eager['"]` |
| `dynamo_config_bypass` | any `torch._dynamo.config.<flag>` assignment in agent edits |
| `fullgraph_disable` | regex on compile-call lines for `fullgraph\s*=\s*False` |
| `compile_call_modified` | any change to a `torch.compile(...)` call |
| `manual_seed_insertion` | new `torch.manual_seed` / `torch.cuda.manual_seed` calls in correctness-comparison paths |
| `model_layer_disable` | known model-config disables (`layerdrop=0`, `dropout=0`, etc.) — case-specific lookup |
| `input_schema_change` | hardcoded constants for shape-related parameters (`MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH`, fixed `seq_len`, etc.) — case-specific lookup |

Output: `escape_hatches: list[str]` written into each trial's `result.json`, surfaced as a column in `fingerprints.csv`. The first three rows of the table generalize across cases; the model_layer_disable / input_schema_change rules are per-case lookups that authors maintain alongside the case definition.

### P2 — Add a `clean_fix` verdict alongside `fix_status` (cheap, deduplicates the metric debate)

Today: a trial is `general` if the runner's canonical validation passes. Tomorrow: also report `clean_fix = (fix_status == 'general' AND escape_hatches == [])`. Headline rates use `clean_fix`. `fix_status` stays around for analysis but stops being the marketing number.

For VitsModel under this rubric: `general` rate is 10/30; `clean_fix` rate is 5/30 (the V8 trials minus `debug_graph_breaks_V8_2`). The story shifts from "V6 and V8 both work" to "only V8, and only when no side door is found."

### P3 — Treat agent-self-reported metrics as untrusted by default

The runner already validates against canonical inputs. Make this principle explicit in the harness: agent-side reports of `graph_break_count`, `max_diff`, and similar are *recorded* in the trial artifacts but never *used* in any verdict computation. This avoids future drift where someone wires an agent-reported number into a metric and gets fooled by a backend swap.

Document this as a load-bearing invariant in `discovery/runner.py` and the per-case author guide.

### P4 — Variant rules become intent-spec (medium cost, big payoff)

The current variant DSL is rule-text in the prompt, plus file-write restrictions enforced by the runner. Extend the runner enforcement to pattern-spec rules: a variant declares the escape-hatch tags it forbids, and a post-agent gate verifies the diff doesn't trigger any of them. If it does, the trial is auto-marked `escape_hatch_found` and Phase C labeling can treat it accordingly.

V8 in this scheme would specify `forbidden_hatches: [backend_eager_swap, dynamo_config_bypass, fullgraph_disable, compile_call_modified, manual_seed_insertion]`. The `debug_graph_breaks_V8_2` smuggling would be caught automatically.

### P5 — Build a routing-pattern catalog as a research artifact (ongoing)

Each case's escape-hatch census becomes a row in a per-model catalog. After several cases, the catalog will reveal *which routing patterns are model-agnostic* (e.g., `backend_eager_swap` is universal) versus *case-specific* (e.g., `MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH` is VITS-only). Model-agnostic patterns get promoted into the default forbidden set for new variants. Case-specific patterns get added by the case author when scoping the case.

The catalog itself becomes a description of the agent population's repertoire under constraint — research data about what AI agents actually do when measurement gates are imposed, useful beyond just our fix-finding setting.

### Sequencing

P1 + P2 + P3 are a single ~half-day patch to the runner: add the detector, plumb the columns, document the trust principle. Worth doing before the next case (Mistral3 / VitsModel-as-Phase-3b). P4 is a follow-up week. P5 starts populating itself once P1 is in.

The structural insight to carry forward: *we discovered we are studying not only "does the agent find the model-layer fix" but also "what does the agent do to make the measurement say success."* The latter has been invisible until we looked. Skill-discovery experiments going forward should report on both axes by default.

## Open loops surfaced (or carried forward)

1. **`_measure_case.py` perf-infra bug** — already in flight. Limits perf-data coverage to 14/30 here.
2. **`debug_graph_breaks_V8_2` perf-skip edge case** — different failure mode from the canonical perf-infra bug; perf step produced no logs. Worth noting alongside the perf-infra issue.
3. **First-`gb=0` turn detection** in stream.jsonl — not implemented for this analysis; would let us separate "found early, refined to wall" from "found at the buzzer." Backlog.
4. **Train-mode max_diff = 2.0 noise floor** from layer-drop / dropout — same caveat as Phase 0 audit. The `general` verdict is math-correct.
