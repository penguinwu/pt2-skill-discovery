"""Per-trial filesystem-integrity check.

Detects file modification contamination after a discovery trial — the case
where an agent (or any subprocess in the trial) writes to a directory the
trial was supposed to leave untouched.

Why this exists
---------------
Sandbox isolation is unverifiable by inspection. Even with a correct sandbox
(per-trial copy + PYTHONPATH redirect), an agent that reads the case source
and discovers the absolute site-packages path can `Edit`/`Write` directly to
the shared file, bypassing the sandbox entirely. claude's `--disallowed-tools`
and `permissions.deny` patterns were tested and do NOT enforce path-level
write restrictions reliably (verified 2026-04-28).

So we don't trust isolation. We *detect* contamination after the fact, every
trial, and exclude contaminated trials from analysis.

Design
------
Three tiers of checks, increasing depth:

**Tier 1 (always-on, ~2s/walk):** mtime+size baseline.
At trial start: walk every monitored dir, record `{relpath: (mtime_ns, size)}`.
At trial end: re-walk, diff. New / missing / mtime-changed / size-changed
paths are flagged.

**Tier 2 (only on Tier 1 flag, OR every Nth trial as a sanity sample):**
Hash + line-count diff. Computes md5 + unified-diff line counts for each
suspect file, persisted as forensic evidence.

**Tier 3 (defense in depth, always-on, ~10ms):** canary files.
At trial start: write `__contamination_canary_<trial_id>` with a known hash
to each monitored dir. At trial end: verify hash unchanged + delete.
Catches the rare mtime-stable, size-stable overwrite case.

Scope (whitelist mindset)
-------------------------
Monitored = "places agents must NOT touch":
  - Every `/home/pengwu/envs/*/lib/python*/site-packages/` (all venvs)
  - The discovery repo `/home/pengwu/projects/pt2-skill-discovery/`
  - The sister corpus repo `/home/pengwu/projects/oss-model-graph-break-corpus/`
  - `/home/pengwu/.myclaw-shared/` (skill files)

Allowed write roots (subtracted from monitored at scope-resolution time):
  - `out_dir` for the trial (per-trial output dir)
  - per-trial sandbox dirs (anything under `out_dir/sandbox/`)

This is `monitored - allowed = scanned`.

Public API
----------
    snapshot = take_snapshot(monitored_dirs, allowed_roots) -> Snapshot
    plant_canaries(monitored_dirs, trial_id) -> CanaryRecord
    ... trial runs ...
    verify_canaries(canary_record) -> CanaryResult
    diff = diff_against_snapshot(snapshot, monitored_dirs, allowed_roots) -> Diff
    if diff.has_changes:
        report = deep_inspect(diff, snapshot)  # Tier 2

Self-test (run as `python -m scripts.filesystem_integrity`):
  - clean trial (no changes) → no flags
  - file modified in-place → flagged with size/mtime delta
  - new file added → flagged as new
  - file deleted → flagged as missing
  - mtime-stable overwrite → caught by canary
  - canary deleted → caught
  - canary modified → caught
  - allowed-root writes → IGNORED (sandbox + out_dir don't trip detection)
