"""Constraint variant catalog for the discovery agent.

Each variant = a constraint sentence that gets composed into the per-trial
prompt. Variants steer the agent toward (or away from) particular strategy
families. The discovery harness runs the same case under multiple variants and
clusters the resulting fixes by strategy fingerprint.

See discovery/design.md §4.2 for the rationale.
