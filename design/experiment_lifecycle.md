# Discovery Experiment Lifecycle — 5 Gates

**Status:** mandatory for all discovery EXPERIMENTS (multi-trial investigations using the harness).
**Owner:** Otter
**Last revised:** 2026-04-27

## When this lifecycle does NOT apply

The lifecycle is for INVESTIGATIONS that use the harness — "I want to learn X about model Y by running M variants × N trials." It is NOT for engineering work on the harness itself.

The following are NOT experiments and do NOT need this lifecycle (no plan.md scaffold, no umbrella issue, no Gate 0 framing):

- *Building or modifying harness code* (`runner.py`, `validate_runner.py`, `perf.py`, `revalidate.py`, `run_config.py`, `launch_parallel.py`, `merge_results.py`, `_lifecycle_gate.py`). These are Tier B/C engineering changes — apply ordinary code review + `discovery/smoke_test.py` discipline.
- *Adding or refactoring case files* (in `discovery/cases/`). These are configuration changes — apply smoke_test (Layer 2 catches per-case schema regressions).
- *Documentation rewrites* (this doc, design.md, findings.md). Tier C.
- *Refactors that don't change behavior.* Tier C.

The line: ask "what investigation am I doing? what hypothesis am I testing?" If the honest answer is "I'm building / modifying the tool," it's not an experiment — don't scaffold one.

The first time you USE the new harness against a real case to investigate something, THAT is when an experiment dir + Gate 0 plan.md is appropriate. Different question (about the model / break shape / variant), different framing, different gates.

## Why this exists

Without explicit gates, the natural failure mode is: launch a multi-hour run → bug surfaces → fix → re-launch → bug surfaces again. Each "I'll fix it on the next run" burns ~30 minutes of human attention and erodes trust in the data we ship. This doc forces the *bug-vs-cost asymmetry* to favor catching bugs early at low compute cost rather than late at high attention cost.

Concrete bug list this would have caught (2026-04-27 V8 work):
- `_eager_self_check` shape-mismatch crash → Gate 1 smoke (broken-path test)
- State contamination in repeated `_run_canonical_check` → Gate 3 small-batch reproducibility check
- Incomplete `set_seed` reseed (torch-only, missed numpy / python.random) → Gate 2 single-trial validation (eager_self_diff != 0 with np.random in forward)
- `_dynamo.explain` deprecated in corpus → Gate 0 forced "what's the corpus-canonical alternative?" check
- *Filesystem-contamination class (2026-04-28):* agents in batch2 issued `Edit`/`Write` tool calls against the SHARED site-packages `modeling_vits.py` after reading the case source and discovering the absolute path. Validation results stayed sound (per-trial sandbox + PYTHONPATH redirect protected validate.py imports) but filesystem hygiene was broken. Now caught automatically by the 3-layer protection wired into `run_config.py` — see "Built-in contamination protections" below.

## Built-in contamination protections (active in `run_config.py` since 2026-04-28)

Every trial run via `discovery/run_config.py` automatically gets three independent layers of protection against the agent modifying shared filesystem state. Experiments don't need to opt in — these run unconditionally.

- *Layer A — Detection (~5s/trial).* `discovery/filesystem_integrity.py` snapshots all monitored site-packages dirs (mtime+size) at trial start, plants canary files, and re-walks at trial end. Any change → `result.json.filesystem_integrity.contamination_detected: true` → trial auto-excluded by `merge_results.py`.
- *Layer B — Prevention (~50ms/trial).* The case's watched site-packages files (e.g. `modeling_vits.py`) are `chmod 444` at trial start, restored at trial end. Atexit + SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers ensure restoration on crash.
- *Layer C — Intent (~negligible).* `stream.jsonl` is parsed post-trial for any Edit/Write tool call to a path outside `(sandbox + out_dir + /tmp/discovery-runs/<case>)`. Catches blocked-write *attempts* (chmod refused) AND out-of-scope writes detection misses.

If a trial fires `agent-wrote-outside-sandbox:N` flag, investigate the prompt — the case body may be inadvertently encouraging the agent to discover shared paths. If a trial fires `shared_filesystem_touched`, it's auto-excluded; either re-run with same setup or investigate why chmod-RO was bypassed (sudo, perm change, etc.).

## The 5 gates (non-skippable, in order)

### Gate 0 — Frame (no compute)

Write to the experiment's `plan.md` BEFORE touching code or compute:

- *Question:* one sentence — what does this experiment answer?
- *Done criteria:* specific observables that constitute a clean answer (e.g., "fix_status distribution across N trials, with at least one trial in each `general` / `setup-required` / `none` category")
- *Loose ends from prior runs:* either *closed* (with the verifying commit / observation) or *explicitly deferred* (with written reason). NO "I'll come back to this."
- *Infra changes since last similar run:* enumerate file changes; identify which gates are most at risk (e.g., new schema field → Gate 2 schema check; new validator behavior → Gate 1 smoke test addition)
- *Estimated total wall time:* sum of per-trial × trial count; if > 30 min, must complete Gates 1-3 first

### Gate 1 — Infra readiness (cheap, < 1 min)

- Run `python -m discovery.smoke_test`. Must exit 0.
- If a NEW component or behavior was added since last smoke run that isn't covered by an existing test, ADD A TEST for it FIRST. Both happy-path AND broken-path. Until that test exists, Gate 1 is failed.
- Verify all watched files are restored to `.original` (`ls discovery/cases/*.original 2>/dev/null` matches expected; or programmatic check).
- Verify `git status` clean for any harness file you've touched (don't leave uncommitted methodology changes during an experimental run).

### Gate 2 — Single-trial validation (~5 min)

- Launch ONE trial with the smallest valid configuration.
- Inspect EVERY field of `result.json`:
  - Schema: every expected field present?
  - Values: any unexpected `null` / `NaN` / placeholder / default-only values?
  - Cross-field consistency: e.g., `fix_status="general"` should imply `gb_in_agent_run=0`; `perf_shape_sanity="ok"` should imply `eager_ms` is a real number
- If ANY anomaly: STOP. Diagnose. Fix. Re-run single trial. Do not advance.
- Only proceed if single-trial result is end-to-end clean.

### Gate 3 — Small-scale validation (3 trials, ~15 min)

- Launch 3 same-shape trials.
- Confirm reproducibility: 3 trials with the same setup should produce similar (not necessarily bit-identical, but pattern-similar) results across schema fields.
- Confirm cross-trial state hygiene: trial 3 should not look qualitatively different from trials 1 + 2 in ways that have no causal explanation. If trial 3 differs from trials 1+2 *and* you can't name a cause, you have state contamination — STOP.
- Inspect aggregate signals (distributions, summaries): do they match what per-trial inspection would predict?
- Only proceed if reproducibility is clean.

### Gate 4 — Full-scale run

- Only after Gates 0-3 are all green AND closed.
- Mid-run: spot-check partial results every ~5 trials. If a pattern emerges that wasn't visible at small scale, halt and diagnose — don't let the full run finish on bad data.
- Post-run: aggregate findings; revisit your Gate 0 done criteria — were they actually answered, or did you drift?

## The closure rule (the one we keep violating)

> Before launching any new run, every loose end from the prior run is either CLOSED with verified fix or EXPLICITLY DEFERRED with a written reason in the experiment's `plan.md`. No silent drops. No "I'll come back to this." No "next run will tell us."

If a prior run surfaced 3 issues and you've fixed 2, the third must be either (a) closed before launch, (b) deferred with explicit "deferred because X, will revisit by Y", or (c) the run charter must be revised to acknowledge it operates on the un-fixed state.

## How to use this doc

For every discovery experiment:

1. **First touch** — read this doc top-to-bottom. Update `plan.md`'s top section with Gate 0 framing.
2. **Before any compute** — run through Gate 0 checklist; verify all loose ends closed/deferred.
3. **Before any launch** — run Gate 1 (smoke test) AND verify the gate it gates is appropriate.
4. **For multi-trial runs** — Gates 2 → 3 → 4 in strict order; cannot skip Gate 2 even if Gate 1 passed; cannot skip Gate 3 even if Gate 2 passed.

```

## When to revise this doc

- A bug surfaces in production that the current gates wouldn't have caught → ADD a check to the relevant gate
- A gate becomes consistently noisy / false-positive → tune it; don't drop it
- Discovery harness gets a new structural component → Gate 1's smoke test gains a corresponding test
